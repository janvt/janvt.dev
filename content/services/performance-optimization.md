Sometimes things are just too slow... I can help you with that! I have loved optimizing software and systems for years, from loop-unrolling and writing inline SSE2/3 Assembler code before dual-cores were a thing, to modern PHP applications and massive cloud-based systems. I love building the right monitoring and figuring out which metrics are important and then improving those numbers.
