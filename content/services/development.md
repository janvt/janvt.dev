I have over 12 years of software development experience. Starting with very low-level C, Assembler and micro-chip programming, then moving up to Windows development in C++. I later transitioned to web development, mostly in JavaScript and PHP. However, I have always found it simple to be a polyglot, transitioning between languages has always been easy. With a solid grasp of the fundamentals, execution details become less important.
