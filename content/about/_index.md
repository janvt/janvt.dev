# About me

## ...as a Software Engineer

I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience, mostly in web development with a strong focus on PHP, the Symfony framework, backend application design and optimizing processes and tooling. I am super passionate about improving feedback cycles, from tests to release cycles to business metrics. Of course, faster is better.

## ...as an Adventurer
Since August 2019, I live in my bright green van. In my free time I hang out with my dog Chester, spend exorbitant amounts of time biking and trail running and try to spend as much time as possible in the mountains. I love traveling Europe, looking for adventure along the way.
